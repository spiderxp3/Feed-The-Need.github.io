# Accenture Innovation Challenge 2022

In our quest to harness the wellness of society by enriching the value of charity, we devised our concept of Feed The Need. This concept addresses the food, clothing, education, and healthcare needs of poverty-stricken people. It offers hope beyond bleak reality to reach a world beyond the confines of poverty. By helping the needy and teaching the next generation about generosity, Feed The Need will light a lamp of a bright future not only by helping the poor but by augmenting the legacy of kindness.

## About Project
Feed The Need establishes a transparent link between donors and volunteers by expressing concerns for groups deprived of basic amenities and bridging the gap between rich and poor. It transcends the liberty for donors to lend materialistic help to poverty-stricken people in any way they desire. Volunteers promise to engage in the ethical course of charity by acting as a link between the donors and the needy. Volunteers will deliver donations directly to the right person, from food chains, primary health centres, or local shops. Furthermore, regular education will offer them a solid foundation for a better life. Historically, physically challenged people have been excluded from charity work. Quest will allow them to contribute in any way they can, which will inspire others around the world to get involved.

# Sustainable Development Goals targeted by us
</br>

<b> 1. Zero Hunger </b>

* Starvation and rising inflation have resulted from the inefficient management of food. Globally, poverty is one of the most critical factors contributing to the prevailing hunger crisis.</br>

* We develop a unique strategy for food donation to address this root cause of poverty. By contributing a small share of his meal, the common man can step up the ladder of charity, increasing the numbers of meals donated and quenching the hunger of those in need.</br>

* Since donations will come from recognized food chains, the food will not just be provided, but also reviewed for nutrition and quality. The strong relationship between volunteers and food chains will ensure that people's donations reach the needy on time.</br>



<b> 2. Good Health and Wellbeing </b>

* Those who are marginalized or vulnerable are often the worst affected. They are deprived of the information, money, or access to healthcare that would help them to prevent and treat disease. Lack of nutrition deteriorates the menstrual and reproductive health of women due to poverty.

* Many generous donors, government agencies and primary healthcare centres are involved in our application. As a result, health aids like medicine, sanitary pads, and other healthcare resources will be accessible to those who need them. 

* Quests raised by volunteers will make them aware of various health schemes launched for their benefit and spread awareness about health and hygiene. This will lay a strong foundation for the healthcare of the underprivileged section of society.



<b> 3. No Poverty </b>

* Abject poverty perpetuates a disproportionate level of poverty, leading to ignorance. Especially, in a developing country like India factors like overpopulation, lack of awareness in rural areas and disparity in the availability of resources contribute to exacerbating poverty.

* Our application is one of a kind solution for eradicating poverty. The resources we intend to provide will not only improve their miserable plight but also make their lives more secure. It will ensure that basic amenities are provided free of charge and conveniently at their location. Aids in the form of food, clothing and essentials for survival will allow them to work for their betterment


<b> 4. Quality Education </b>

* There are hundreds of millions of children around the world who do not have access to basic education. The majority of poor households spend their income on necessities like food and fuel, and education is marginalized. Moreover, parents who have not received a proper education tend to underestimate the value of education and hesitate to spend money on schools.

* As a result of incorporating education quests in our application we developed an idea for educating those in need. In quest, we strive to enlighten the deprived section's future in a positive manner. They will be able to shape their identities as confident, literate individuals if they are educated and provided with the requisite resources. 

* Volunteers can contribute in this way regardless of any obstacles they have faced for a long time like being physically handicapped. Along with imparting basic education to the young generation and children, quests will also escalate about serious issues that are in dire need of being addressed. 



<b> 5. Reduced Inequalities </b>

* As a result of inequitable resource distribution, poverty has widened the gap between wealthy and poor. Because of inequality, poor people often face discrimination, stigma, and negative social stereotypes that limit their social participation, employment opportunities, and political support.

* With our application, we will assist those in need while preserving existing resources. In addition, instilling hope in them by informing them about the various schemes and opportunities offered by the government will encourage them to lead a better life. Participation in quests will also enliven social inequality. Having them publicly indulged will disintegrate the intersection of poverty and inequality.

## Women's Health and Hygiene

* According to the World Health Organization, around 2 billion people still lack access to proper sanitation facilities. Additionally, the Coronavirus outbreak has caused an unfortunate shortage of sanitary pads in India, making the lives of poor women difficult and their health worse. Women and fetuses in the womb are both negatively affected by the lack of nutrition and health aids during pregnancy. In addition to menstrual health and maternity, it is crucial to make people aware of girls' education.

* In light of all of this, we developed our application that will benefit women in many ways. Associating our application with organizations that provide healthcare and basic aids, along with opportunities that raise awareness, will help to uplift women living in poverty today. As well as providing medical care and nutritional support through our application, it will increase awareness about health and hygiene, both of which are in dire need of strengthening. We will reach the right women in the shortest period of time with the facilities provided by the government.

## üìå Workflow
The application works on three profile roles namely volunteer, food chains and individual donations. Each part is interrelated and dependent on the other for attaining the goals of the project.</br>

<b> 1. Volunteer </b> </br>
Volunteers play an important role in facilitating donations, in the sense that they transfer donations from donors and food chains to those in need. It is their responsibility to reserve meals and donation items, pick them up at a specific time, and donate them to the needy. In addition, they can organize a campaign named quest to raise awareness, and educate marginalized groups.

<b> 2. Food Chains(organisations) </b> </br>
Many restaurants, hotels, and food chains in the city will be taking care of food donations. Through our application, customers at food chains can order a meal suited to their budget along with their meals. The database of restaurants will be updated with meals and the addition of meals will take place cumulatively. When volunteers book meals, restaurants have to make meals available at the time specified. In addition to this, government organizations and healthcare centres are also able to donate healthcare aids and other necessities through this application by registering as Individual Donors.

<b> 3. Individual Donors </b> </br>
They are groups of generous donors who wish to donate items such as books and clothes.Donor need only to post a donation with a description and an image of the item, set up a pickup time, and the volunteer will pick up donation at their doorstep.

The button of praise has been added so that people can show appreciation for their efforts. Furthermore, volunteers can also showcase their donations on various social media platforms.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159064807-3892af5d-3e05-4a18-a9c3-9664031db522.jpeg" width=250 height=500>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57085508/159864286-3e44fc31-ac0a-43d6-bd9d-192819aa87d1.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>


‚úèÔ∏è These activities will be common for all three roles, apart from these other essential activities in the application based on the role have been mentioned below: 

## üìå  Individual Donors 
### I) Add Donation 
The donor can add items they wish to donate. Donors need to provide a description, a title, and an image of the item they are donating along with a suitable pick-up time.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159823398-525b9bb3-3559-4485-88cd-9355d4ac6e43.jpeg" width=250 height=500>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57085508/159884507-d104b892-ad66-44cf-a7d0-5ff28ad774cb.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>


### II) Donation Status
Donors have the option to oversee donations made by them via status - booked, posted, and distributed. In this activity, they can view the card views of volunteers and their information. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159823646-94e45e9c-f167-469c-8c1f-1af2eb57e758.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>


## üìå Food Chains
### I)Meal Information
Food chains are supposed to add descriptions and images of meals they wish to provide. Booking meals through POS is only possible once the meal details have been added.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159895220-e6ecb84c-b7f0-4797-a1c3-27ef2dbce76c.jpeg" width=250 height=500 align="center"></p>

### II) Point of Sale(exclusively for users)
The interface allows the public to order a meal for the needy from the food chain. The number of meals they can book is not limited; additionally, their name and contact information is required for records. This interface will also reflect the donation meal provided by the restaurant.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159894081-4a754bd9-95ee-475d-8689-109902631005.jpeg" width=250 height=500 align="center">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159823875-ff27ca6c-35fb-4095-a3f9-ff2295acb531.jpeg" width=250 height=500 align="center"></p>

‚úèÔ∏èTo make the process of food donation more transparent, we designed POS so that donors can see the description of meals they are donating at food chains. 

### III) Status of Donation
As a way of ensuring donations reach the right people, restaurant/food chains will keep a record of volunteers in the form of card views and information until the donation is completely verified.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159824259-8bd3c99f-44ea-485a-8124-e460998f087b.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>

## üìå Volunteers
### I) Advertisement for Individual Donations
The goal of this activity is to bring to their attention all the donations (clothes, household items, etc.) that are available near them and should be donated as soon as possible. A volunteer may choose to donate at pickup time.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159827085-2a8d0974-6e5a-4ab1-8a85-74c6ef51b52c.jpeg" width=250 height=500 align="center"></p>



### II) Information to book Meals
From booking to verification, this activity will be a complete food donation activity. Foremost volunteers are supposed to click on an additional component at the bottom right corner of the activity page.

‚úèÔ∏è This part of the application is divided majorly into four parts- <br>

<b> 1. List of Food Chains </b><br>
In this section, volunteers can access a list of food chains in the form of card views and choose any chain that best meets their needs, such as segveral meals and nearby locations.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159892828-b89d4a8b-39c5-41d3-8c02-ae1d4d366330.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>


<b> 2. Booking of Meal </b><br>
Volunteers need to book meals by specifying the number of meals they require and the pickup time. Volunteers must always order fewer meals than the total available through the food chain.
 
<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159824635-f75ce7c2-d567-44b6-888f-defcca8f9f54.jpeg" width=250 height=500>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159824705-d8452be0-657a-4d34-b695-050d1f6f0c07.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>

<b> 3. Staus of Meal </b><br>
This activity will specify the status of the meal from the time of Pick Up until it is verified. Four associated statuses include-
* Booked: Meal is booked but not picked from the food chain
* Picked: Time-span from Pick Up time to verify
* Verified: Complete successful donation
* Cancelled: Due to some cause meal is cancelled from the food chain.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159064468-2f561013-d698-463a-99cf-cba27fad8536.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>

<b> 4. Verification </b><br>
Authentication takes place at this point in the application. A volunteer has to upload a picture that has both a donation and a needy person in one frame, and face recognition will be done by machine learning (ML). The number of donations uploaded must match the number of images uploaded. Volunteers can also share and flaunt their donations on social media handles.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57085508/159866023-f4d51ef9-bd78-465c-9079-4c5c42c36968.jpeg" width=250 height=500>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57085508/159864152-c9a558e7-3d10-4e49-8a02-5d10af91d25b.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>
 
### III) Quest Activity
This is an initiative raised by volunteers for extra-social activities that involve educating children, distributing items, or bringing awareness to social issues. Volunteers can raise a quest anytime through a quest fragment in navigation.

‚úèÔ∏è Quest activity is divided into 3 subparts - <br>

<b> 1. Add Quest Activity </b><br>
By adding details like the date and location of the quest, the number of volunteers required with aim of the quest they can post a quest. The volunteer who raises a quest directly is posted as a lead volunteer.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159828106-7c43ec87-d713-4903-bbb8-8171ad150473.jpeg" width=250 height=500 align=></p>

<b> 2. Lead Volunteer Activity </b><br>
When a volunteer posts a quest, details such as its location, goal, and date will appear in their quest activity. Note that a volunteer can raise only one quest at a time.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/170709241-08d06522-39aa-4c75-b82f-9b80fc4912a3.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>


<b> 3. Participating Volunteer </b><br>
If volunteers do not raise a quest, the advertisement for other quests will be displayed here as a card view, and volunteers can choose to participate in any quest. They have to comment on their aim of participation to be part of the quest.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/170711518-e3cf718d-49f7-4597-8c77-849d4ff69856.jpeg" width=250 height=500>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159830110-ebea58f9-efe5-4d09-be33-474bc1c57122.jpeg" width=250 height=500>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159830238-437d14e3-7a4a-4283-96ee-0759c4d9ace3.jpeg"  width=250 height=500></p>
